This is a small project for people trying to make an IOS Startup Information ScrollView. 

Some apps already have such kind of ScrollViews. They only run once when the app starts up, and mostly 
used for teaching how to use the app.

Basically all the codes are in the ViewController and Storyboard.

Storyboard has 3 components : ScrollView , PageControl and Skip Button. When the Skip button is clicked it fires an variable 
change. In the ViewController you should push to another ViewController when it is skipped , and also you should check that variable 
and if it is already changed you should push to another ViewController.

There is a plist File that you can put your information content page images into, 
    plist is an Array File : you can put images 
    also you can put arrays in that plist , to show them animated. (cool feature) ha? 
    
    
I dont know how to make it a cocoapod yet if someone willing to help i will be more than happy !
